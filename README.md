# consoleappskeleton
Skeleton of a console application in Python. Can be executed in QPython 3 on Android which is currently running the Python 3.2 interpreter.

The Gof command design pattern is used here. The concrete commands are instanciated by the Controller and passed to the Requester. According to the parsed user input, the Requester returns the right command filled with the parsed data.
